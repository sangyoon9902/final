The aim of this revision was to present the most current information in a usable form for physicians and allied health professionals, including fitness and clinical exercise professionals, nurses, physician assistants, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians, and health care administrators. This edition also places heightened emphasis on preventing illness in apparently healthy persons and those \"at risk\" as well as on treating patients with chronic disease.",

This textual compendium of individual chapters and accompanying appendices largely represents the fundamental knowledge that must be mastered by candidates applying for ACSM’s certifications in preventive and rehabilitative exercise programming. For special populations not covered in the *Guidelines*, the reader is referred to *Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities*.

The tables in the section on electrocardiography (Appendix C) have been expanded to provide a quick reference guide to ECG interpretation, including a sequential approach to evaluating heart rate, rhythm, axis, hypertrophy, and infarction. Appendix D (Metabolic Calculations) has been rewritten to improve its clarity and accuracy, with specific reference to the calculation of energy expenditure for cycle ergometry and stepping. Appendix F presents information about ACSM Certification Programs™, including revised knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) underlying each level of certification. The latter was largely based on input from the Committee on Certification and Education, selected ACSM members, and the results of a role delineation survey of certified exercise professionals.",

The intent of these reports was twofold:  \n1) to increase both professional and public awareness of the health benefits associated with daily participation in physical activity, and  \n2) to draw attention to the amounts and intensities of physical activity necessary to achieve these benefits, levels lower than those thought to be necessary for the traditional physiological training effect associated with exercise (3).",

In other words, some activity is better than none, and more activity—up to a point—is better than less. Although the optimal dose of physical activity has yet to be defined, the dose–response relationship between physical activity and various health benefits clearly supports the need for professionals to encourage the public to engage in at least moderate amounts and moderate intensities of daily physical activity (i.e., activities that are approximately 3 to 6 metabolic equivalents [METs] or the equivalent of walking at 3 to 4 mph [15 to 20 minutes to walk 1 mile] for most healthy adults) (1). The public health benefits of increasing physical activity within the general population are potentially enormous due to both the high prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and the impact increased physical activity has on disease risk (4). Therefore, exercise program professionals must know existing public health statements pertaining to physical activity and must stay abreast of the evolving scientific literature related to these physical activity recommendations. When knowledge of the additional health and fitness benefits associated with greater quantities and intensities of physical activity (i.e., exercise) is combined with the fact that the list of chronic diseases favorably affected by exercise continues to grow, there remains a clear need for medically—and scientifically—sound preventive and rehabilitative exercise programs. These exercise programs should be designed, supervised, and conducted by qualified personnel.",

In addition, an ever-increasing number of prospective epidemiologic studies supports the notion that both a physically active lifestyle and a moderate-to-high level of cardiorespiratory fitness independently lower the risk for various chronic diseases (Table 1-1) (9). Inverse dose-response relationships for physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness are strongest for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality; however, lower incidence rates for hypertension, obesity, cancer of the colon, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis have also been consistently reported in the literature. The bulk of the epidemiologic evidence supporting the health benefits of a more active lifestyle has been based on studies using single assessments of physical activity or fitness. However, results from recent studies correlating *increases* in physical activity or fitness in initially sedentary or unfit adults with subsequent reductions in mortality support the hypothesis that regular activity increases longevity (10,11). Although increased physical activity or fitness may yet prove beneficial in reducing risk for the other chronic diseases listed in Table 1-1, more research is needed to firmly establish these relationships. Moreover, because of the multifactorial nature of the chronic diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle, there may well be no single minimal dose of physical activity that yields protection from all of the diseases and conditions listed in Table 1-1.",

The safety of this practice has now been substantiated. One study evaluated the safety of diagnostic exercise testing by physical therapists and reported morbidity and mortality rates of 3.8 and 0.9 per 10,000 tests, respectively (19,20). Using a nurse-supervised exercise stress testing laboratory, there were 12 complications and no deaths during 4050 tests (21); however, another series reported 3 deaths in more than 12,000 exercise tests conducted by specially trained nurses (22).

The submaximal cycle ergometer test described in Chapter 4 has been administered to thousands of adults (ages 18 to 65 years) in worksite health promotion programs and community health and fitness centers, with no reported deaths, MIs, or lasting morbid events. Pretest screening and submaximal exercise testing were performed by nurses or ACSM Certified Exercise Test Technologists_SM (25). The Canadian Aerobics Fitness Test has been used worldwide by an estimated 1 million people with no reported untoward events other than minor musculoskeletal injuries and isolated syncopal episodes (26). Thus, submaximal physical fitness testing can be administered safely by qualified personnel in nonmedical settings when prefaced by appropriate pretest screening such as the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q; see Chapter 2). Nevertheless, the limitations of using arbitrary submaximal heart rates (e.g., 70 or 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate) as end points for exercise testing are well documented, in view of the variation in measured maximal heart rate for any given age (standard deviation ± 10 to 12 beats·min⁻¹). Consequently, a calculated “submaximal” heart rate for fitness testing may evoke maximal effort in some cases, but only modest aerobic demands in other similarly aged persons.",

Symptomatic or silent myocardial ischemia, sodium-potassium imbalance, increased catecholamine excretion, and circulating free fatty acids may all be arrhythmogenic (Fig. 1-1).

This rate was 7 times the estimated death rate from heart disease during more sedentary activities (30). For patients with coronary artery disease, the relative risk of developing cardiac arrest during vigorous exercise may be more than 100-fold greater than what might be expected to occur spontaneously (31). The relative risk of acute MI is also 2 to 6 times higher during vigorous physical exertion (6 or more metabolic equivalents [METs]) than during other activities; however, the risk varies greatly depending on the patient’s usual frequency of physical activity (32,33).\n>\n> These data seem to contradict the widely held belief that regular exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular events.

One retrospective survey of YMCA sports centers revealed 1 death and 1 cardiac arrest per 2,897,057 and 2,253,267 person-hours, respectively (35). A slightly higher rate of cardiovascular complications was reported in a 5-year retrospective survey of cardiac events that occurred during or immediately after exercise in community recreation centers. Forty-eight facilities reported 30 nonfatal and 38 fatal cardiovascular complications in 33,726,000 participant hours of exposure; the resultant mortality and morbidity rates were 1/887,526 person-hours and 1/1,124,200 person-hours of participation, respectively (36). One preventive medicine center had 2 nonfatal complications during a total of 374,798 person-hours of exercise, equivalent to maximum risk estimates (upper 95% confidence limits) ranging from 0.3 to 2.7 and 0.6 to 6.0 events per 10,000 person-hours for men and women, respectively (37). A recent review concluded that approximately 0.75 and 0.13 per 100,000 young male and female athletes and 6 per 100,000 middle-aged men die during vigorous exertion per year (27).",

An early survey of 30 cardiac rehabilitation programs in North America revealed an average of 1 nonfatal and 1 fatal cardiovascular complication every 34,673 and 116,402 participant-hours, respectively (38). In 1986, investigators reported 29 cardiovascular events (21 cardiac arrests and 8 MIs), including 3 fatal events, during 2,351,916 hours of outpatient cardiac exercise therapy (39). Accordingly, the incidence of complications was 1 cardiac arrest per 111,996 patient hours, 1 MI per 293,990 patient-hours, and 1 fatality per 783,972 patient-hours of exercise. Unfortunately, the data from both surveys antedate the current use of risk stratification procedures, revascularization, and newer pharmacotherapies for coronary patients. Thus, these complication rates may not necessarily be extrapolated to contemporary cardiac patients. More recent studies suggest 1 major cardiovascular complication in every 60,000 participant-hours of outpatient cardiac exercise therapy (40-42). At this rate, a typical rehabilitation program with 95 patients exercising 3 hours per week could expect 1",

Factors that may contribute to the apparently normal ECG responses include inadequate cardiac stress, insufficient ECG lead monitoring, drug therapy that masks anginal pain and/or ischemic ST-segment depression, and baseline ECG anomalies (e.g., substantial ST-segment depression at rest, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle-branch block) that make the exercise ECG uninterpretable with respect to evidence of myocardial ischemia. Recent studies have also shown that most acute MIs occur at sites in coronary arteries that previously had less than 70% obstruction on a recent angiogram (45). Apparently, a series of triggering events (called plaque rupture) can cause abrupt occlusion of a coronary artery, even at modest obstructions. Exercise testing is largely ineffective in detecting mild-to-moderate coronary lesions (i.e., less than 70% occlusion); in contrast, significant obstructions are often manifested as ischemic ST-segment depression, angina pectoris, or both. It is impractical to use diagnostic exercise testing to prevent untoward events because of the extremely low rate of cardiovascular complications in asymptomatic adults who exercise (35), the high rate of abnormal ECGs among physically active people (46), the exorbitant costs of mass exercise testing and follow-up of abnormal studies with expensive additional evaluations, and the uncertainties associated with exercise-induced ST-segment depression in persons with a low likelihood of heart disease (47).",

Although routine exercise testing to forestall exercise-related cardiovascular complications has been questioned (35,44), exercise testing clearly aids in identifying the individual who is at increased risk for symptomatic or asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, or both.

Heart rate and myocardial oxygen demands increase disproportionately to keep up with increasing aerobic requirements. Persons who are not acclimated to heat and who are exposed to temperatures greater than 24°C experience added heart rate increases of 1 beat·min⁻¹ per °C (Fig. 1-2) and 2 to 4 beats·min⁻¹ per °C with concomitant increased humidity (64). Recommendations for exercising in hot and/or humid weather are summarized in Appendix E and include the following: maintain hydration by drinking fluids before, during, and after activity; decrease the exercise dosage (e.g., speed, duration, resistance) at temperatures greater than 27°C and/or greater than 75% relative humidity; exercise during the cooler parts of the day; wear light",

The risk factor list presented in Table 2-1 should not be viewed as an all-inclusive list of risk factors for CAD, but rather as a list of risk factors with clinically relevant thresholds which should be considered collectively when making decisions about the level of medical clearance, the need for exercise testing prior to program entry, and the level of supervision for both exercise testing and exercise program participation.

To provide some general guidance on the need for a medical examination and exercise testing prior to participation in a moderate-to-vigorous exercise program, ACSM suggests the recommendations presented in Table 2-2 for determining when a diagnostic medical examination and exercise test are appropriate and when physician supervision is recommended. Although the testing guidelines are less rigorous for those individuals considered to be low risk, the information gathered from an exercise test may be useful in establishing a safe and effective exercise prescription for these individuals. The exercise testing recommendations reflect the notion that the risk of untoward events increases as a function of exercise intensity (e.g., moderate versus vigorous). Although several descriptions of “moderate” and “vigorous” exercise are listed in Table 2-2, exercise professionals should choose the most applicable definition for their setting when making decisions about the level of screening prior to exercise training and physician supervision during exercise testing. The degree of medical supervision of exercise tests varies appropriately from physician-supervised tests to situations in which there may be no physician present. The degree of physician supervision may vary with local policies and circumstances, the health status of the patient, and the experience of the laboratory staff. The appropriate protocol should be based",

Aggressive risk factor interventions aimed at smoking cessation and cholesterol reduction, and efficacious drugs, including β-blockers, aspirin or other antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents, have produced regression or limitation of progression of angiographically documented coronary atherosclerosis and significant reductions in recurrent cardiac events (15). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled clinical trials on post-myocardial infarction patients showed that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation decreased cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality by 20 to 24% (16–18), especially as a component of multifactorial rehabilitation (i.e., 26% reduction in mortality versus 15% in exercise-only trials), with no significant difference in the rate of nonfatal recurrent cardiac events (19). However, these antedated results (including many studies in the 1970s) cannot necessarily be extrapolated to survival of patients following coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (20), or to patients who have undergone contemporary thrombolytic, revascularization, and/or pharmacotherapies.

For many persons, especially those with coronary artery disease (CAD) and other cardiac disorders, the exercise test and accompanying physical examination are critical to the development of a safe and effective exercise program. In today’s health care environment, not all persons will be approved for routine exercise testing. However, it is important to work with health care providers in understanding the importance of the baseline exercise evaluation. This evaluation provides for greater assurance of exercise safety by identifying residual myocardial ischemia, significant arrhythmias, and the effect of certain medical therapies.",

Isolated systolic hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg and staged appropriately (e.g., 170/82 mm Hg is defined as stage 2 isolated systolic hypertension). In addition to classifying stages of hypertension on the basis of average BP levels, clinicians should specify presence or absence of target organ disease and additional risk factors.

Normal values for lung function are based on age, gender, and height. As such, there are no \"best\" reference equations for predicting normal lung function, and considerable variability exists for commonly used prediction equations.

Most definitions of physical fitness refer strictly to the capacity for movement, and the following definition is typical in this regard: _A set of attributes that people have or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity_ (1). Such definitions are, by nature, broad and can be interpreted as encompassing an array of fitness components, some of which relate to athletic performance but not to health. Accordingly, the term “health-related physical fitness” has been used to denote fitness as it pertains to disease prevention and health promotion. One definition of health-related physical fitness is: _A state characterized by (a) an ability to perform daily activities with vigor, and (b) a demonstration of traits and capacities that are associated with low risk of premature development of the hypokinetic diseases (i.e., those associated with physical inactivity)_ (2).",

Resting measurements such as heart rate, blood pressure, height, weight, and body composition should be obtained first. When all fitness components are assessed in a single session, resting measurements should be followed (in order) by tests of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular fitness, and flexibility. Testing cardiorespiratory endurance after assessing muscular fitness (which elevates heart rate) can produce inaccurate results regarding an individual’s cardiorespiratory endurance status—particularly when submaximal tests are used. Likewise, dehydration resulting from cardiorespiratory endurance tests might influence body composition values if measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).",

Test anxiety, emotional problems, food in the stomach, bladder distention, and room temperature and ventilation should be controlled as much as possible. To minimize anxiety, the test procedures should be explained adequately, and the test environment should be quiet and private. The room should be equipped with a comfortable seat and/or examination table to be used for resting blood pressure and heart rate and/or electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, in addition to the standard testing equipment required. The demeanor of personnel should be one of relaxed confidence to put the subject at ease. Testing procedures should not be rushed, and all procedures must be explained clearly prior to initiating the process. These seemingly minor tasks are easily accomplished and are important in achieving valid and reliable test results.",

An increase in the prevalence of overweight children was also observed over a similar time period, but the increase was primarily attributed to the heaviest children being heavier (5).

However, it has become clear that the density of the FFM is not constant, but varies with growth, maturation, aging, gender, and ethnicity. Use of a single equation to convert body density to percent body fat for all populations can result in systematic errors. In addition, within any group of the same gender, age, and ethnicity, the density of the FFM will vary from individual to individual, resulting in an error of estimate of about ±2% body fat, even when the measurement technique is carried out flawlessly. Techniques that divide body mass into three (fat, water, and solids; or fat, mineral, and lean soft tissue) or four (fat, water, mineral, and protein) components allow for accurate estimates of the density of the FFM. This, in turn, results in more accurate equations to estimate body fatness from body density.\n* Measurement of lung residual volume (RV) is needed for accurate calculation of body density. The most accurate way is to measure RV at the time underwater weight is measured, but RV measured prior to the test (with subject in testing posture) is also considered acceptable. Regression equations using age and height to predict RV, or formulas using a fraction of vital capacity to predict RV, introduce large errors into the calculation of body density.\n* Underwater weight is more accurately measured using a force-transducer system than using a spring-loaded autopsy scale.\n* Finally, hydrostatic weighing requires expensive, special equipment, and the procedure is somewhat complicated and time-consuming. For some individuals, submersion of the head underwater might be difficult or anxiety-provoking.",

Individuals with more fat on the trunk, especially abdominal fat, are at increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and premature death compared with individuals who are equally fat, but have more of their fat on the extremities. Traditionally, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR—the circumference of the waist divided by the circumference of the hips) has been used as a simple method for determining body fat pattern (15). Waist is measured at the narrowest part of the torso (above the umbilicus and below the xiphoid process); hip, at the maximal circumference of the hips or buttocks region, whichever is larger (above the gluteal fold). Health risk increases with WHR, and standards for risk vary with age and gender. For example, health risk is *very high* for young men when WHR is more than 0.94 and for young women when WHR is more than 0.82. For ages 60 to 69 years, the WHR values are greater than 1.03 for men and greater than 0.90 for women for the same risk classification (6,15). More recently, the focus has shifted from WHR to waist circumference alone (13).",

The principle behind this technique is that the amount of subcutaneous fat is proportional to the total amount of body fat. However, the exact proportion of subcutaneous-to-total fat varies with gender, age, and ethnicity (16). Therefore, regression equations used to convert sum of skinfolds to percent fat must consider these variables for greatest accuracy. Box 4-1 presents a standardized description of skinfold sites and procedures. To improve the accuracy of the measurement, it is recommended that one train with a skilled technician, use videotapes that demonstrate proper technique, and attend workshops for that purpose.

In general, the prediction of percent fat from BIA measurements is similar to that of skinfolds, *as long as the recommended protocol is followed*. The subject must do the following:",

VO₂max can be estimated with reasonable accuracy during conventional exercise test protocols, by considering test duration at a given grade and speed on a treadmill or power output on a cycle ergometer, using the prediction equations found in Appendix D. Maximal tests have the disadvantage of requiring participants to exercise to the point of volitional fatigue and might require physician supervision (see Chapter 2) and emergency equipment. Maximal exercise testing, however, offers increased sensitivity in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic individuals (see Chapter 5).",

The advantages of field tests are that large numbers of individuals can be tested at one time and little equipment (e.g., a stopwatch) is needed. The disadvantages are that they are all presumably maximal tests, and by their nature, are unmonitored. However, VO₂max can be estimated from test results.\n* **Motor driven treadmills** can be used for submaximal and maximal testing and are often used for diagnostic testing. They provide a common form of physiologic stress (i.e., walking) and can accommodate the least to the most fit individuals across the continuum of walking to running speeds. Nevertheless, a practice session might be necessary in some cases to permit habituation and reduce anxiety. On the other hand, treadmills are usually expensive, not easily transportable, and make some measurements (blood pressure) difficult.\n* **Mechanically braked cycle ergometers** are excellent test modalities for submaximal and maximal testing. They are relatively inexpensive, easily transportable, and allow blood pressure and the electrocardiogram (if appropriate) to be easily measured. The main disadvantage is that cycling is an unfamiliar method of exercise for many Americans, often resulting in limiting localized muscle fatigue. Cycle ergometers provide a non–weight-bearing test modality in which work rates are easily adjusted in small work-rate increments, and subjects tend to be least anxious using this device (25). The cycle ergometer must be calibrated and the subject must maintain the proper pedal rate because most tests require that heart rate be measured at specific work rates. Electronic cycle ergometers can deliver the same work rate across a range of pedal rates, but calibration might require special equipment not available in most laboratories.",

      "text": "In contrast to the single-stage test, Maritz et al. (30) measured HR at a series of submaximal work rates and extrapolated the response to the subject’s age-predicted maximal heart rate. This has become one of the most popular assessment techniques to estimate VO\\(_{2max}\\), and the YMCA test is a good example (18). The YMCA protocol uses two to four, 3-minute stages of continuous exercise (Fig. 4-2). The test is designed to raise the steady-state HR of the subject to between 110 beats·min\\(^{-1}\\) and 85% of the age-predicted maximal HR for at least two consecutive stages. An important point to remember is that two consecutive HR measurements must be obtained within this HR range to predict VO\\(_{2max}\\). In the YMCA protocol, each work rate is performed for 3 minutes, and heart rates are recorded during the final 15 to 30 seconds of the second and third minutes. If these heart rates are not within 6 beats·min\\(^{-1}\\) of each other, then that work rate is maintained for an additional minute. The heart rate measured during the last minute of each stage is plotted against work rate. The line generated from the plotted points is then extrapolated to the age-predicted maximal heart rate (e.g., 220 − age), and a perpendicular line is dropped to the x-axis to estimate the work rate that would have been achieved if the person had worked to maximum (Fig. 4-3). VO\\(_{2max}\\) can be estimated from the work rate using the formula in Appendix D. The two lines noted as ±1 SD in Figure 4-3 show what the estimated VO\\(_{2max}\\) would be if the subject’s true maximal HR were 168 or 192 beats·min\\(^{-1}\\), rather than 180 beats·min\\(^{-1}\\). Part of the error involved in estimating VO\\(_{2max}\\) from submaximal HR responses occurs because the formula (220 − age) can provide only an estimate of maximal HR.",

However, caution should be exercised when using these data to determine the fitness status for any given individual. One must consider whether the data set was based on a representative population, used the same test (mode; maximal versus submaximal; stage duration; etc.), and whether VO₂max was estimated or measured directly. Perhaps a more useful approach is to use the baseline test as a reference point to chart progress in cardiorespiratory fitness over time.",

The pulse palpation technique involves “feeling” the pulse by placing the first and second fingers over an artery (usually the radial artery located near the thumbside of the wrist or the carotid artery located in the neck near the larynx). The pulse is typically counted for either 10 or 15 seconds, and then multiplied by 6 or 4, respectively, to determine the per-minute HR. Although the carotid pulse might be easier to obtain, one should not press too hard with the palpating fingers because this could produce a marked bradycardia in the presence of a hypersensitive carotid sinus reflex. For the auscultation method, the bell of the stethoscope should be placed to the left of the sternum just above the level of the nipple. This method is most accurate when the heart sounds are clearly audible and the subject’s torso is relatively stable. Over the years, several automated heart rate monitors have been developed. Heart rate monitors (“watches”) have proven to be accurate and reliable, provided there is no outside electrical interference (e.g., emissions from the display consoles of computerized exercise equipment).",

The rubber bladder of the blood pressure cuff should encircle at least two-thirds of the subject’s upper arm. If the subject’s arm is large, a normal-size adult cuff will be too small, making the readings higher than they actually are (the converse is also true). Blood pressure measurements should be taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer adjusted to eye level or a recently calibrated aneroid manometer.

Borg’s RPE scale was developed to allow the exerciser to subjectively rate his or her feelings during exercise, taking into account personal fitness level, environmental conditions, and general fatigue levels (32). Currently, two RPE scales are widely used: the original or category scale, which rates exercise intensity on a scale of 6 to 20, and the revised or category-ratio scale of 0 to 10. This category-ratio scale uses terminology better understood by the subject, thereby providing the tester with more valid information by which to further direct the test.",

The term \"muscular fitness\" has been used to describe the integrated status of muscular strength (maximal force a muscle can generate at a given velocity) and muscular endurance (ability of a muscle to make repeated contractions or to resist muscular fatigue) (35,36). The assessment of muscular strength and endurance represents a continuum with \"muscular strength\" at one end of the assessment scale and \"muscular endurance\" at the other. Tests allowing few repetitions of a task are measuring strength, while those in which great numbers of repetitions can be done are measuring endurance. Before common tests to measure muscular fitness are described, there are some points worth noting (35,36):",

This is due to the marked variation in the number of repetitions one can perform at a fixed percent of a 1-RM for different muscle groups (e.g., leg press versus bench press) (37,38). At the very least, the 6-RM or 10-RM can be used to simplify the testing procedures outlined above to measure a 1-RM. In addition, if the participant is following a 10- to 12-RM weight training program, improvement in muscular fitness can be tracked over time independent of the true 1-RM. However, for research purposes the true 1-RM should be measured (35). Valid measures of general upper body strength include the 1-RM values for bench press or military press. Corresponding indices of lower body strength include 1-RM values for leg press or leg extension. Norms for the bench press and leg press are provided in Tables 4-7 and 4-8, respectively.",

Just as muscular strength is specific to the muscles involved, flexibility is joint specific. Therefore, no single flexibility test can be used to evaluate total body flexibility. Laboratory tests usually quantify flexibility in terms of range of motion, expressed in degrees. Common devices for this purpose include various goniometers, electrogoniometers, the Leighton flexometer, inclinometers, and tape measures. Visual estimates of range of motion can be useful in fitness screening, but are inaccurate relative to directly measured range of motion. These estimates can include neck and trunk flexibility, hip flexibility, lower extremity flexibility, shoulder flexibility, and postural assessment (43).",

Asymptomatic individuals generally represent those with a low likelihood (i.e., <10%) of significant CAD. Diagnostic exercise testing in asymptomatic individuals is generally not indicated. However, exercise testing may be useful in asymptomatic persons when multiple risk factors are present (1), indicating at least a moderate risk of experiencing a serious cardiovascular event within 5 years (2). It may also be indicated in those who are about to start a vigorous exercise program (see Chapter 2), or those involved in occupations in which cardiovascular events may affect public safety. In general, patients with a high probability of disease (i.e., typical angina, prior coronary revascularization or myocardial infarction [MI]) are tested to assess residual myocardial ischemia and prognosis rather than for diagnostic purposes. Although exercise electrocardiography for diagnostic purposes is less accurate in women, test sensitivity is not affected; thus, a standard exercise test remains the initial diagnostic evaluation of choice.",

      "text": "Exercise testing is useful in the evaluation of persons with known or suspected CAD. Data derived from the exercise test are most useful when considered in context with other clinical data. Data regarding symptoms, functional capacity, and myocardial ischemia during the exercise test must be considered together. The magnitude of ischemia caused by a coronary lesion is generally proportional to the degree of ST-segment depression, the number of electrocardiographic (ECG) leads involved, and the duration of ST-segment depression in recovery. It is inversely proportional to the ST slope, the double product at which the ST-segment depression occurs, and the maximal heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and metabolic equivalent (MET) level achieved. Several numerical indices of prognosis have been published (3,4) including the Duke treadmill exercise score (3) (Fig. 5-1), which has been validated on a population of inpatients referred for cardiac catheterization and outpatients (men and women) referred for noninvasive evaluation of CAD, but without recent MI or coronary revascularization. This nomogram is considered by many to be the major advance in exercise testing over the past decade, as is demonstrated by its inclusion in all of the major guidelines.",

Submaximal tests may be used prior to hospital discharge at 4 to 6 days after acute MI. Low-level exercise testing provides sufficient data to make recommendations about the patient’s ability to safely perform activities of daily living and serves as a guide for early ambulatory exercise therapy. Symptom-limited tests are usually performed at more than 14 days after MI (1). As contemporary therapies have led to dramatic reductions in mortality after MI, the use of exercise testing in the evaluation of prognosis has changed. Patients who have not undergone coronary revascularization and are unable to undergo exercise testing appear to have the worst prognosis. Other indicators of adverse prognosis in the post-MI patient include:\n* ischemic ST-segment depression at a low level of exercise (particularly if accompanied by reduced left ventricular systolic function);\n* functional capacity of less than 5 METs; and\n* a hypotensive blood pressure response to exercise.",

The most common exercise protocols and the predicted VO₂ for each stage are illustrated in Figure 5-3. The Bruce treadmill test remains the most commonly used protocol; however, it employs relatively large increments (i.e., METs per stage) every 3 minutes. Consequently, patients often fail to attain a leveling off or plateauing of physiologic responses, and the exercise capacity may be markedly overestimated when it is predicted from exercise time or workload. Protocols with larger increments (e.g., Bruce, Ellestad) are better suited for screening younger and/or physically active individuals, whereas protocols with smaller increments (e.g., Naughton, Balke-Ware, USAFSAM), that is, 1 MET per stage or lower, are best for older or deconditioned individuals and patients with cardiovascular or respiratory disease.",

Submaximal tests can be useful for making activity recommendations, adjusting the medical regimen, and identifying the need for further interventions. These tests are frequently stopped at a predetermined level, such as a heart rate of 120 beats·min⁻¹ or a MET level of 5, but this varies based on the patient and clinical judgment. When performed in this manner, submaximal tests have been useful in risk stratifying post-MI patients.",

An arm cycle ergometer can be purchased as such, or modified from an existing stationary cycle ergometer by replacing the pedals with handles and mounting the unit on a table at shoulder height. Similar to leg cycle ergometers, these can be braked either mechanically or electrically. Work rates are adjusted by altering the cranking rates and/or resistance against the flywheel. Work rate increments of 10 W every 2 to 3 minutes, at a cranking rate of 60 revolutions per minute, have been applied to a broad spectrum of patients (13). Arm ergometry is best performed in the seated position with the fulcrum of the handle adjusted to shoulder height. Electrocardiographic leads should be placed to minimize muscle artifact from upper body movement. Blood pressure can be measured with the individual dropping one arm and continuing to arm crank with the other, or during brief rest periods between stages. However, systolic blood pressures taken by the standard cuff method immediately after arm crank ergometry are likely to underestimate “true” physiologic responses (14).",

For most patients, physical demands are considered appropriate if the 8-hour energy expenditure requirement averages less than or equal to 50% peak METs and peak job demands (e.g., 5 to 45 minutes) are within guidelines prescribed for a home exercise program (e.g., 80% peak METs or lower).

Some patients may benefit from further work testing if job demands differ substantially from that evaluated with GXT, especially patients with borderline physical work capacity in relationship to the anticipated job demands, those with concomitant left ventricular dysfunction, and/or those concerned about resuming a physically demanding job. Job tasks that produce disproportionate myocardial demands compared with a GXT include those requiring static muscular contraction, work combined with temperature stress, and intermittent heavy work (15). Typical physiologic responses include a greater pressor response to work involving a static muscular contraction, a progressive rise in heart rate and a decrease in stroke volume over time for work in a hot environment, and a sudden increase in myocardial oxygen demands with intermittent heavy work. Whenever sufficient information is not available to determine a patient’s ability to resume work within a reasonable degree of safety, tests simulating the task(s) in question can be administered. For patients in whom concerns exist regarding potential for serious arrhythmias or ischemia on the job, ambulatory ECG monitoring may be considered. Specialized work simulators (e.g., Baltimore Therapeutic and Valpar work simulators) are also available (17), although simple, inexpensive tests can be set up easily to evaluate types of work not evaluated with a GXT (15). Examples of the latter include weight carrying and repetitive lifting test protocols, which can be easily modified to meet specific job demands.",

Peak $$\\dot{V}O_2$$ is the most accurate measurement of functional capacity and is a useful index of overall cardiopulmonary health. Measurement of expired gases is not necessary for all clinical exercise testing, but the additional information can provide useful physiologic data.

Having the patient perform a cool-down walk after the test may decrease the risk of hypotension but can attenuate the magnitude of ST-segment depression. When the test is being performed for nondiagnostic purposes, an active cool-down is usually preferable; for example, slow walking (1.0 to 1.5 mi·h⁻¹) or continued cycling against minimal resistance. Monitoring should continue for at least 5 minutes after exercise or until ECG changes return to baseline.

Advantages of exercise echocardiography over nuclear testing include a significantly lower cost, the absence of exposure to ionizing radiation and a shorter amount of time for testing.

A common protocol with sestamibi is to perform rest images 30 to 60 minutes after intravenous administration of sestamibi followed by exercise (or pharmacologic stress) 1 to 3 hours later.

Consequently, sestamibi is the preferred imaging agent when performing tomographic images of the heart using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). SPECT images are obtained with a gamma camera, which rotates 180 degrees around the patient, stopping at preset angles to record the image. Cardiac images are then displayed in slices from three different axes to allow visualization of the heart in three dimensions. Thus, multiple myocardial segments can be viewed individually, without the overlap of segments that occurs with planar imaging (25). Perfusion defects that are present during exercise but not seen at rest suggest myocardial ischemia. Perfusion defects that are present during exercise and persist at rest suggest previous MI or scar. In this manner, the extent and distribution of ischemic myocardium can be identified.",

Current standards for exercise testing suggest that nonphysician supervision is appropriate only for apparently healthy adults and low to moderate risk coronary patients, where permitted (1,41–44). Moreover, these guidelines endorse continuous physician presence for the testing of patients who are at increased risk of exercise-related cardiovascular complications (e.g., patient with aortic stenosis, exertional angina, heart failure, or high-grade arrhythmias). Despite these recommendations, empiric experience suggests that many larger hospitals and medical centers currently use paramedical personnel in the direct supervision of exercise testing, with a physician immediately available in the vicinity of the exercise testing area (45).",

Specially trained health care professionals adhere to published contraindications to and end points for exercise testing and do so with caution and a minimum of personal interpretation.

Exercise testing as a part of routine health screening in apparently healthy individuals is generally inappropriate (2). Such testing can have potential adverse consequences (psychologic, work and insurance status, costs for subsequent testing) by misclassifying a large percentage of those without CAD as having disease. As stated in Chapter 5, exercise testing in asymptomatic persons with multiple risk factors may provide some useful information, although this practice cannot be strongly recommended based on available data (2). It is likewise difficult to choose a chronological age beyond which exercise testing becomes valuable as a screening tool prior to beginning an exercise program because physiologic age often differs from chronological age. In general, if the exercise is more strenuous than vigorous walking, the guidelines in Table 2-2 are recommended. The potential ramifications resulting from mass screening must be considered and the results of such testing must be applied using the predictive model and Bayesian analyses. Test results should be considered as probability statements and not as absolutes.",

A negative index (i.e., <0) is considered abnormal, assuming that the magnitude of ST-segment depression (from the baseline to the J point) is at least 1.0 mm. For example, slow upsloping ST-segment depression would be considered abnormal if the depression and slope were −2.0 mm and 1.0 mV/sec, respectively.

The primary focus on achieving health-related goals has been on prescribing exercise for improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, and most recently, strength. In 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) suggested that the focus should be broadened to address the needs of all sedentary individuals, especially those who cannot or will not engage in structured exercise programs. Increasing evidence has shown that regular participation in moderate-intensity physical activity (3 to 6 metabolic equivalents [METs]) is associated with health benefits, even when aerobic fitness (e.g., maximal oxygen uptake, $\\dot{V}O_{2max}$) remains unchanged. To promote this message, the CDC and ACSM recommended that “every US adult should accumulate 30 min[utes] or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week” (3). The Activity Pyramid has been suggested as one way to facilitate this objective (Fig. 7-1).",

Others saw the new recommendation as part of a continuum of physical activity recommendations that meets the needs of almost all individuals to improve health status. For example, the upper end of the intensity range for moderate physical activity (3 to 6 METs) in the ACSM/CDC recommendation represents the lower end of the intensity scale to improve fitness for many sedentary, overweight, asymptomatic individuals. Consequently, the combined ACSM/CDC and traditional ACSM recommendations represent a true continuum for one of the primary variables in exercise prescription, that is, the intensity of exercise. Those who follow the more recent recommendation (3) will experience many of the health-related benefits of physical activity, and if they are interested in achieving higher levels of fitness, they will be ready to do so. This chapter describes how to structure exercise prescriptions to achieve and maintain fitness goals.",

Improvements in the latter three components follow the two major principles of training: overload and specificity. The principle of overload states that for a tissue or organ to improve its function, it must be exposed to a load to which it is not normally accustomed. Repeated exposure is associated with an adaptation by the tissue or organ that leads to improved functional capacity. An exercise prescription specifies the intensity, duration, and frequency of training, and it is the interaction of these three variables that results in the cumulative overload to which the tissue or organ must adapt. The principle of specificity states that training effects derived from an exercise program are specific to the exercise performed and muscles involved. For example, low-resistance, high-repetition exercises cause increases in the number of mitochondria in the active muscles, leading to improvements in muscular endurance with little change in strength. In contrast, heavy resistance exercise promotes increases in strength, with little or no change in endurance. An additional example of specificity is seen in the varied cardiovascular responses to different modes of exercise even when the intensity is set at the same %VO\\(_{2max}\\) or rating of perceived exertion.",

As discussed in Chapter 2, an exercise test is not required for all individuals before beginning a physical conditioning program.

The risk of orthopedic injury may be increased with the latter; however, programs emphasizing moderate-to-vigorous exercise with a longer training duration are recommended for most individuals (6). The ACSM recommends an intensity of exercise corresponding to between 55 and 65% (55/65%) to 90% of maximum heart rate (HR_max), or between 40 and 50% (40/50%) to 85% of oxygen uptake reserve (VO_2R) or HR reserve (HRR) (6). The VO_2R is the difference between VO_2max and resting VO_2. Similarly, the HRR is the difference between HR_max and resting HR. When exercise intensities are set according to VO_2R, the percent values are approximately equal to the percent values for the HRR (6,17). Consequently, use of the VO_2R improves the accuracy of calculating a target VO_2 from a HRR prescription, especially for low-fit clients, but does not alter the current methods of calculating target heart rates.",

During an exercise session, the assumption is that the individual will achieve a steady-state HR response in the prescribed range; in reality (and certainly during discontinuous exercise) HR is likely to be both above and below the prescribed intensity.

The corresponding target heart rates are approximately 130 and 168 beats·min⁻¹.",

Sixty to 80% of the HRR is equal to about 60 to 80% of $$\\dot{V}O_{2max}$$ for most fit individuals, but is more closely linked to the %$$\\dot{V}O_2$$R across the entire range of fitness levels. The latter point is most important when working with low-fit clients. Table 7-1 shows the target HR range for the %HR_max and the HRR methods, with different resting heart rates used in the latter calculation (19). The small but systematic differences between the two HR methods are because the %HR_max method represents about 55 to 75% $$\\dot{V}O_{2max}$$, and the %HRR method represents about 60 to 80% $$\\dot{V}O_2$$R. Either method can be used to approximate the range of exercise intensities known to increase or maintain $$\\dot{V}O_{2max}$$.",

When exercise intensity is above a minimum threshold (lower for low-fit and higher for high-fit) the **total volume** of exercise is important in achieving and maintaining fitness. The duration of exercise recommended by the ACSM reflects that interaction (20 to 60 minutes of continuous or intermittent [minimum of 10-minute bouts] aerobic activity accumulated throughout the day). However, the risk of both cardiovascular and orthopedic injuries increases at the higher intensities. Consequently, exercising at 70 to 85% HR_max or 60 to 80% HRR for 20 to 30 minutes, excluding time spent warming up and cooling down, enables most individuals to achieve health, fitness, and weight management goals (6). Consistent with the manner in which the intensity of a session is gradually increased over weeks of training, the duration (e.g., 30 minutes) can begin with as little as 4 to 6, 5-minute bouts with rest periods between bouts for those with low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. The duration of the exercise bout can be increased progressively over time until the goal is achieved.",

      "text": "Although deconditioned persons may improve cardiorespiratory fitness with only twice-weekly exercise, optimal training frequency appears to be achieved with 3 to 5 workouts per week. The additional benefits of more frequent training appear to be minimal, whereas the incidence of lower extremity injuries increases abruptly. Consequently, the ACSM recommends an exercise frequency of 3 to 5 d·wk⁻¹. For those exercising at 60 to 80% HRR or 70 to 85% HR_max, an exercise frequency of 3 d·wk⁻¹ is sufficient to improve or maintain VO₂_max. For those exercising at the lower end of the intensity continuum, exercising more than 3 d·wk⁻¹ may be needed to achieve the caloric expenditure associated with weight loss and fitness goals. Patients with functional capacities of less than 3 METs may benefit from multiple brief daily exercise sessions; 1 to 2 short sessions per day are most appropriate for those with 3 to 5 MET capacities; and 3 to 5 sessions per week are recommended for individuals with functional capacities of more than 5 METs. Clearly, the number of exercise sessions per week varies depending on the caloric goals, participant preferences, and limitations imposed by the participant’s lifestyle.",

      "text": "The interaction of physical activity intensity, duration, and frequency determines net caloric expenditure from the activity. It is generally accepted that many of the health benefits and training adaptations associated with increased physical activity are related to the total amount of work accomplished during training (3,25,26). However, the caloric thresholds necessary to elicit significant improvements in VO₂_max, weight loss, or a reduced risk of premature chronic disease may be different. Therefore, individualized exercise prescriptions should be designed with energy expenditure goals in mind. The ACSM recommends a target range of 150 to 400 kcal of energy expenditure per day in physical activity and/or exercise (25,26). The lower end of this range represents a minimal caloric threshold of approximately 1000 kcal per week from physical activity and should be the initial goal for previously sedentary individuals. Based on the dose-response relationships between physical activity and health and fitness, individuals should be encouraged to move toward attainment of the upper end of the recommended range (e.g., 300 to 400 kcal per day from activity) as their fitness levels improve during the training program.",

One useful method to approximate the caloric cost of exercise is by using the following equation based on the MET level of the activity:\n>\n> $$\n> \\text{(METs} \\times 3.5 \\times \\text{body weight in kg)}/200 = \\text{kcal/min}\n> $$\n>\n> This formula helps an individual understand the components of the exercise prescription and the volume of exercise necessary to achieve the caloric goals of the program. Consider the following example. The weekly goal of the exercise program has been set at 1000 kilocalories for an individual who weighs 70 kg, and the MET level of the prescribed activity is 6 METs. In this example, the *net* caloric expenditure from the exercise would be 5 METs because 1 MET of the activity represents resting metabolic rate. Therefore, the *net* caloric expenditure from the exercise is 6 kcal/min, requiring 167 minutes per week to attain the 1000 kilocalorie threshold. Given a 4 d·wk⁻¹ program, the individual would require approximately 42 minutes per day to achieve the 1000 kcal goal (or 33 minutes per day, 5 d·wk⁻¹). Working backward from the caloric goal to determine the volume of exercise needed to reach the goal is useful in determining the appropriate exercise prescription components.

Exercise professionals should recognize that recent physical activity recommendations from the ACSM/CDC (3) and the Surgeon General (26) include 30 minutes of *moderate* physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. While some apparently healthy but sedentary individuals may not be able to attain this initial level of activity, they should be encouraged to progress to this goal during the first few weeks of the training program.",

This stage typically lasts 4 to 5 months, during which intensity is progressively increased within the upper half of the target range of 50 to 85% of HR reserve. Duration is increased consistently every 2 to 3 weeks until participants are able to exercise at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity for 20 to 30 minutes continuously. The frequency and magnitude of the increments are dictated by the rate at which the participant adapts to the conditioning program. Deconditioned individuals should be permitted more time for adaptation at each stage of conditioning. Age also should be taken into consideration when progressions are recommended; experience suggests that adaptation to conditioning may take longer in older individuals (6).",

For example, arm or leg training resulted in only minor improvements in submaximal and maximal leg or arm exercise responses, respectively. Thus, subjects trained by leg exercise failed to demonstrate a conditioning bradycardia during arm work, and vice versa (Fig. 7-4) (27). Similar muscle-specific adaptations have been shown for blood lactate (28) and pulmonary ventilation (29). These findings suggest that a substantial portion of the training effect derives from peripheral rather than central changes, including cellular and enzymatic adaptations that increase the oxidative capacity of chronically exercised skeletal muscle (30).",

However, the latter may predominate in some patient subsets, for example, cardiac patients with left ventricular dysfunction (34). Although the conditions under which the interchangeability of arm and leg training effects may vary, there is evidence to suggest that the initial fitness of the subjects as well as the intensity, frequency, and duration of training may be important variables in determining the extent of cross-training benefits (35).",

Static stretching involves slowly stretching a muscle to the point of mild discomfort and then holding that position for an extended period of time (usually 10 to 30 seconds). The risk of injury is low, it requires little time and assistance, and it is quite effective. For these reasons, static stretching is the most commonly recommended method. Ballistic stretching uses the momentum created by repetitive bouncing movements to produce muscle stretch. This type of stretch can result in muscle soreness or injury if the forces generated by the ballistic movements are too great. PNF stretching involves a combination of alternating contraction and relaxation of both agonist and antagonist muscles through a designated series of motions. While research has suggested that PNF stretching produces the largest improvements in flexibility, this technique typically causes some degree of muscle soreness. Moreover, it typically requires a partner trained in the technique and is more time-consuming than alternative methods.",

New theories of risk stratification, recent data on the safety of exercise, and pressures in the era of managed, capitated health care have contributed to a change in traditional cardiac rehabilitation services. There is now movement toward a structure wherein patients follow a regimen of exercise specific to their vocational and recreational needs, with more individualization of the length of program, degree of ECG monitoring, and level of clinical supervision. Such recommendations have been published in the literature (1,2) and form the basis for the risk stratification models presented in Chapter 2. Outcome analysis is an important part of this evolution and includes not only clinical parameters and quality of life, but also recurrent cardiac events as well as physiologic, functional, and health outcomes (3).",

In many instances, patients are now seen for only 3 to 5 days following referral to an inpatient cardiac rehabilitation program. Assessment of tolerance to the anticipated aerobic requirements of daily living (e.g., monitoring signs and symptoms during inpatient activity programs) and emphasis on patient activity counseling and education have become major components of inpatient cardiac rehabilitation.",

General principles for progressing the patient include an increase in exercise (as tolerated by the patient) every 1 to 3 weeks, with a goal of achieving 20 to 30 minutes of continuous exercise before prescribing additional increases in intensity.

Fortunately, patients with low functional capacities respond favorably to lower-intensity activity emphasizing frequent short bouts of exercise with intermittent rest periods. Because these patients often have impaired cardiac function, the emphasis for adaptation shifts to peripheral mechanisms. An example of a progression from intermittent to continuous exercise is found in Table 8-1. It is important to individualize the exercise prescription based on clinical status and symptoms.

      "text": "For most patients, progression toward an independent self-managed program is desirable, but some patients may need to remain in a clinically supervised program. These include patients at high risk for cardiovascular complications, those unable to self-monitor, or those whose adherence depends heavily on group support. As a general rule, most patients should participate in a clinically supervised rehabilitation program for at least 3 months to facilitate both exercise and lifestyle management changes. Clinically supervised programs have traditionally been divided into Phase II and Phase III, both of which are supervised by a clinically trained staff. Given the shifting parameters for classifying cardiac patients and prescribing exercise monitoring and supervision, the progression of patients from Phase II to Phase III should be based on a variety of objectives and outcomes. The shift from continuous ECG monitoring to intermittent monitoring or self-monitoring should take place on an individual basis. No specific guidelines are provided regarding the duration of continuous ECG monitoring; however, the degree of ECG surveillance should be linked inversely with the cardiac stability of the patient. The progression to independent exercise with minimal or no supervision is a decision best reached by the physician with input from the rehabilitation team. General criteria for such decisions are presented in Box 8-5.",

In some instances, a pharmacologic stress test (e.g., dipyridamole or adenosine studies with concomitant myocardial perfusion imaging or dobutamine echocardiography) may have been recently performed. Unfortunately, the data obtained from these tests may be insufficient in formulating an exercise prescription because these evaluations do not provide an assessment of functional capacity, hemodynamic responses and/or symptoms associated with progressive physical exertion, or an ischemic ECG threshold. Furthermore, maximal exercise testing may be inappropriate for some patients at or soon after hospital discharge. Economic issues and the significance of these results are additional reasons why these evaluations may be delayed. However, the referring physician may request an accelerated, low-level exercise rehabilitation program for some patients. Such patients may include those with extreme deconditioning, orthopedic limitations, or those with left ventricular dysfunction who are limited by shortness of breath (24). In these patient subsets, the use of submaximal exercise tolerance testing (i.e., to a perceived exertion of “somewhat hard” to “hard”) is being increasingly employed to assess function and prescribe exercise. Exercise programs for patients without preliminary exercise testing should be implemented conservatively with close medical surveillance; moreover, a period of continuous ECG-telemetry monitoring is highly recommended. The patient should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of exercise intolerance, and blood pressure measurements should be obtained regularly.",

If the echocardiogram or myocardial perfusion imaging results are negative for ischemia, the highest heart rate obtained may be used as a guide to determine the prescribed THR. An abnormal test, however, may signify the need for coronary revascularization, more aggressive medical management (e.g., drug therapy), or both, before initiating a cardiac exercise training program. Because these test results may not necessarily define the ischemic ECG threshold, other complementary methods (e.g., symptoms, Holter monitoring, ECG-telemetry, heart rate monitor [watches]) should be used in conjunction with conservative heart rate guidelines to determine the exercise intensity.",

Resistance training provides an effective method for improving muscular strength and endurance, preventing and managing a variety of chronic medical conditions, modifying coronary risk factors, and enhancing independence in elderly patients (28). Because increased muscle mass correlates with an increased basal metabolic rate, a major component of daily energy expenditure, it complements aerobic exercise for weight control. Strength training has also been shown to attenuate the rate-pressure product when lifting any given load (29). Thus, resistance training appears to decrease cardiac demands during daily activities like carrying groceries or lifting moderate-to-heavy objects, while simultaneously increasing the endurance capacity to sustain these submaximal endeavors (30).",

Because patients with myocardial ischemia and poor left ventricular function may develop wall motion abnormalities or threatening ventricular arrhythmias during resistance training, moderate-to-good left ventricular function and an exercise capacity of greater than 5 METs without anginal symptoms or ischemic ST-segment depression have been suggested as additional prerequisites for participation in traditional resistance training programs (32).

A traditional resistance training program has been defined as one in which patients lift weights corresponding to 50% or more of the maximum weight that could be used to complete one repetition (i.e., 1-repetition maximum, 1 RM) (1).

Importantly, work combined with heat/humidity stress can increase cardiovascular strain as reflected by a disproportionate increase in heart rate.

However, in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, exercise training may result in improved hemodynamics secondary to an enhanced oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle functioning. Studies describing changes in ventricular arrhythmias following exercise rehabilitation have also produced inconsistent results (31). Some investigators have used thallium exercise testing and multiple-gated image acquisition scans on subjects before and after exercise training to assess changes in cardiac function.

The primary goal for persons with angina is to increase the anginal and ischemic ECG threshold by decreasing the rate-pressure product at any given level of submaximal exertion. The patient should be evaluated for evidence of myocardial ischemia before (i.e., during the history), during, and after the exercise test. Especially important are symptoms that may represent classic angina pectoris, such as substernal pressure radiating across the chest and/or down the left arm, back, jaw, or stomach, or lower neck pain or discomfort. Such symptoms can be subjectively rated by the patient on a scale of 1 to 4: 1 = perceptible but mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = moderately severe; and 4 = severe. Teaching the patient to grade anginal symptoms during the exercise test may help determine the intensity of chest discomfort (≥ +2) at which the exercise session should be discontinued or at least decreased in intensity until resolved.

Because symptomatic or silent ischemia may be arrhythmogenic (19), the THR for endurance exercise should be set safely below (≥10 beats·min⁻¹) the ischemic ECG or anginal threshold. A heart rate monitor may be helpful in this regard. Patients with stable angina may, in selected cases, also benefit from prophylactic (preexercise) nitroglycerin and/or intermittent, shorter duration-type exercise on a more frequent basis (e.g., 4 to 6 d·wk⁻¹ with 5 to 10 minutes per session and 2 or 3 sessions per day) (57).

Blood pressure should be checked routinely before and after the administration of nitroglycerin to assess for hypotensive sequelae.

Associated central hemodynamic responses include a decreased cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise, elevated left ventricular filling pressures, compensatory ventricular volume overload, and increased pulmonary and central venous pressures. This scenario often leads to a hyperventilatory response to exercise, lactate accumulation in the blood at low work rates, and early fatigue. Catecholamine levels are usually elevated in this patient subset, and abnormalities in β-receptor density probably contribute to reduced myocardial contractility. In addition, concomitant skeletal muscle abnormalities often result in greater glycolysis, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and increased metabolic acidosis (58).",

If possible, oxygen consumption should be determined by direct gas exchange measurements because aerobic capacity may be markedly overestimated from treadmill exercise time in CHF patients (58). Many of these patients may also be taking multiple medications, including digoxin, diuretics, vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, and antiarrhythmics which have the potential to augment ST-segment changes, lower blood pressure, increase heart rate, and improve performance. Moreover, hypokalemia commonly results from chronic diuretic therapy. The combination of digoxin and altered electrolytes may precipitate malignant ventricular dysrhythmias, which are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in CHF patients. Thus, supervisory staff should be especially vigilant of signs and/or symptoms that suggest a deterioration in clinical status: increasing fatigue, worse-than-usual dyspnea or shortness of breath or angina on exertion, edema, sudden weight gain, or increases in dysrhythmias. Serial ECG and blood pressure monitoring may be helpful in this regard.",

If possible, ancillary study data (exercise echocardiogram, radionuclide studies, gas analysis) may be helpful when formulating the exercise intensity to avoid work rates that produce ischemic wall motion abnormalities (19), a drop in ejection fraction, a pulmonary wedge pressure greater than 20 mm Hg, or exceed the ventilatory threshold (58). Warm-up and cool-down periods should be lengthened to a minimum of 10 to 15 minutes each, and patients should be advised to avoid isometric exertion. Training sessions should initially be brief (e.g., 10 to 20 minutes), including exercise for intervals of 2 to 6 minutes separated by 1 to 2 minutes of rest, and progressively lengthened as the patient’s tolerance improves. Recently, interval exercise training has been used in patients with chronic CHF, applying short bouts of intense muscular loading, with good clinical results and accelerated rehabilitation outcomes (63). Walking, stationary cycling, and other aerobic activities, including arm exercise training, are recommended. These activities may be complemented by resistance training (high repetitions, low resistance) and range-of-motion exercises 2 to 3 d·wk⁻¹. Because the chronotropic response may be impaired, perceived exertion and dyspnea may be used preferentially over heart rate or workload targets.

In other words, except for parasympathetic, postganglionic nerve fibers that are left intact, there is a loss of autonomic modulation (e.g., the heart is decentralized). Consequently, there are numerous differences in the cardiorespiratory, ECG (e.g., two separate P waves may be apparent), hemodynamic, and neuroendocrine responses at rest and during exercise when comparing transplant recipients with age and gender matched healthy individuals. Resting sinus tachycardia (90 to 110 beats·min⁻¹) is common, and systolic and diastolic hypertension may be due to elevated catecholamine levels, the effects of immunosuppressive medications, altered baroreceptor sensitivity, or combinations thereof. The cardiovascular response of the denervated heart to exercise is also different.",

In the denervated heart, the cardioacceleratory response to exercise is delayed, yet cardiac output increases to support the metabolic demand. Studies in cardiac transplant recipients have shown that the initial increase in cardiac output with submaximal exercise is achieved by an increase in stroke volume via the Frank-Starling mechanism because immediate cardioacceleratory stimulation is lacking. At higher work rates, however, the myocardium responds with tachycardia to humoral adrenergic stimulation, specifically to rising plasma norepinephrine levels (70).",

Peak oxygen consumption in untrained cardiac transplant recipients generally approximates 17 ± 5 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ (68). In the early postexercise recovery period, elevated catecholamine levels exert a positive chronotropic effect. As a result, heart rate declines slowly. Collectively, these data indicate an earlier onset of anaerobiosis among transplant recipients than in healthy individuals.",

Because the initial heart rate response is attenuated and may not correspond with exercise intensity, predetermined work rates or MET loads may be preferred, using perceived exertion and dyspnea ratings as adjunctive guides for training. However, large interindividual variations in RPE at a given oxygen uptake have been reported in this patient population (72). With continued exercise it is not uncommon for cardiac transplant patients to approach or exceed the maximal heart rate achieved on a previous exercise test (68). Longer periods of warm-up and cool-down are indicated because the physiologic responses to exercise and recovery take longer. Cardiac transplant recipients should perform aerobic exercises 4 to 6 d·wk⁻¹ while progressively increasing the duration of training from 15 to 60 min/session (68). Low- to moderate-intensity resistance training and range-of-motion activities performed 2 to 3 d·wk⁻¹ may be used to complement this regimen. Moreover, 6 months of resistance training prevents glucocorticoid-induced myopathy in heart transplant recipients and restores fat-free mass to levels greater than before transplantation surgery (73).",

The prevalence of hypertension rises sharply with age and is higher in men than in women and in blacks compared with whites. It may be categorized as primary (cause unknown) or secondary (caused by identifiable endocrine or structural disorders). The 1997 classification system recommended by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI) presented in Table 3-1 describes the stages of hypertension. Although stage 1 hypertension is the most common form of high BP in the adult population, all stages are associated with increased risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events and renal disease. Moreover, high-normal BP (i.e., systolic BP of 130 to 139 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP of 85 to 89 mm Hg) is now known to be associated with an accentuated risk for the development of hypertension and target organ damage (1).",

However, if exercise test results are available and an individual has a hypertensive response to exercise, this information does provide some indication of risk stratification for that patient and the necessity for appropriate lifestyle counseling to ameliorate this increase. In certain instances, medication changes may be appropriate.\n* Endurance exercise training by individuals who are at high risk for developing hypertension will reduce the rise in BP that occurs with age, thus justifying its use as a nonpharmacologic strategy to reduce the incidence of hypertension in susceptible individuals.",

Exercise training at somewhat lower intensities (e.g., 40 to 70% VO₂max) appears to lower BP as much as, if not more than, exercise at higher intensities, which may be especially important in specific hypertensive populations, such as the elderly.\n* Based on the high number of exercise-related health benefits and low risk for morbidity and/or mortality, it seems reasonable to recommend exercise as part of the initial treatment strategy for individuals with stage 1 or stage 2 essential hypertension.\n* Individuals with more marked elevations in BP should add endurance exercise training to their treatment regimen only after initiating pharmacologic therapy; exercise may reduce their BP further, allow them to decrease their antihypertensive medications, and attenuate their risk for premature mortality.\n* Resistance training is not recommended as the primary form of exercise training for hypertensive individuals. With the exception of circuit weight training, resistance training has not consistently been shown to lower BP. Thus, resistance training is recommended as a component of a well-rounded fitness program, but not when done independently.",

To determine the ankle/brachial systolic pressure index (ABI), ankle systolic BP is measured and expressed relative to the brachial systolic BP. Ankle systolic BP and ABI are obtained during supine rest and following exercise. Based on the literature, an abnormal ABI has ranged from 0.80 to 0.97, with a value of 0.90 or less generally considered to be the reference criterion. The normal range of ABI is widely accepted as a value of 1.00 or higher, with values between 0.91 and 1.00 considered to represent borderline peripheral arterial occlusive disease (5). Ankle systolic BP and ABI are reduced after exercise because blood flow is shunted into the proximal leg musculature at the expense of the periphery and distal areas of the leg. Severe lower-extremity PVD is treated initially with cardiovascular disease risk factor modification, exercise training, and medications that decrease blood viscosity (such as pentoxifylline or Trental, dipyridamole or Persantine [Boehringer Ingelheim, Inc., Ridgefield, CT], warfarin or Coumadin [Dupont, Wilmington, DE], and aspirin) (6). Treatment with angioplasty (with or without stenting) or bypass grafting may also be indicated. Weight-bearing exercise (i.e., walking) is preferred to facilitate greater functional changes (7) but may not be well-tolerated initially. As such, prescription of non–weight-bearing exercise (which may permit a greater intensity or longer duration) is a suitable alternative. See Table 10-1 for exercise testing and prescription guidelines. A subjective grading scale for PVD pain is as follows:",

Most cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories. In one category (type 1 diabetes), the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. In the other, much more prevalent category (type 2 diabetes), the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response.

Hypoglycemia may result when too much insulin is present, or if there is accelerated absorption of insulin from the injection site, both of which may occur with exercise. Hypoglycemia occurs not only during exercise, but may occur up to 4 to 6 hours after an exercise bout. To counteract this response, the diabetic may need to reduce his or her insulin dosage or increase carbohydrate intake before or after exercise. In persons taking insulin, consideration should be given to the ingestion of 20 to 30 grams of additional carbohydrate before exercise when the preexercise blood glucose is below 100 mg/dL.",

The most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reported that 33.4% of Americans are overweight (13), representing an increase from the 25% prevalence found in the earlier (1976–1980) survey. Obesity may be classified as a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m² or more, and it is functionally defined as the percent body fat at which disease risk increases. Body fat is reduced when a chronic negative caloric balance exists. It is recommended that both an increase in caloric expenditure through exercise and a decrease in caloric intake be used to accomplish this goal. Exercise increases energy expenditure and slows the rate of fat-free tissue loss that occurs when a person loses weight by severe caloric restriction. Exercise also helps maintain the resting metabolic rate, which contributes significantly to the daily caloric expenditure.",

Recent evidence indicates that “central obesity” (fat deposited primarily in the trunk or abdominal region) is particularly problematic. In addition, obesity often carries a negative social stigma and is associated with a reduced physical working capacity. Because reduction of body fatness is a need or a goal of many exercise program participants, exercise prescrip-",

      "text": "Body composition is determined by a complex set of genetic and behavioral factors. Although the contributing variables are many, the fundamental determinant of body weight and body composition is caloric balance. Caloric balance refers to the difference between caloric intake (the energy equivalent of the food ingested) and caloric expenditure (the energy equivalent of resting metabolic rate, activity, thermic effect of food). The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy is neither created nor destroyed; therefore, body weight is lost when caloric expenditure exceeds caloric intake (negative balance), and weight is gained when the opposite situation exists. One pound of fat is equivalent to approximately 3500 kcal of energy (1 kg approximately equal to 7700 kcal). Although it is predictable that shifts in caloric balance will be accompanied by changes in body weight, the nature of the weight change varies markedly with the specific behaviors that lead to the caloric imbalance. For example, fasting and extreme caloric restriction (starvation and semistarvation diets) cause substantial losses of water and fat-free tissue. In contrast, an exercise-induced negative caloric balance attenuates the loss of fat-free mass during a weight reduction program. Moreover, adjunctive resistance training may help preserve fat-free weight. Both aerobic exercise and resistance training can contribute to the loss of body weight and fat stores and maximize the potential to maintain these changes.",

Two of the most commonly administered battery of tests are the **FitnessGRAM** (1) and the President’s Challenge Test (2). Each provides criterion-referenced standards for interpretation of results. Table 11-1 provides a list of common field tests of physical fitness for children, with specific reference to five components (1,2). Some communities, schools, and surveys develop their own battery of tests and standards of performance (4).

Most children 125 cm or 50 inches tall or taller can be tested on a standard cycle ergometer. Young children are generally less cooperative than adults, often requiring special attention to achieve maximal effort. Assessment of the respiratory exchange ratio and ventilatory threshold may be helpful for test interpretation when maximal effort is not achieved. After peak effort, the workload should be decreased gradually, and the child should be allowed to recover for at least 5 minutes by walking slowly or pedaling with little or no resistance.",

In very young children, emphasis should be directed at active play (rather than exercise), enjoyment, and creative activities that invoke sustained periods of activity. In older children, 20 to 30 minutes of vigorous exercise at least 3 times a week is encouraged for greater benefits (7,11,12). Children typically do not need a heart rate prescription to regulate intensity because they are at low cardiac risk and generally have good ability to adjust exercise according to tolerance or perceived exertion. Children should be encouraged to participate in a variety of activities that exercise all major large muscle groups and include weight-bearing activities to optimize basic skill development, weight management, aerobic fitness, and bone mineral content.

Safety for children should always be of primary concern. Children may experience a higher incidence of overuse injuries or damage the epiphyseal growth plates if exercise is excessive or if the child encounters acute trauma. Risk of injury can be decreased significantly by ensuring appropriate matching of competition in terms of size, maturation or skill level, use of properly fitted protective equipment, liberal adaptation of rules, and proper conditioning and skill development. Whenever new activities are initiated, intensity of effort should start low and progress to higher levels according to tolerance and appropriate increments. The child’s ability to tolerate temperature conditions should be evaluated carefully to avoid thermal injury (10). Children thermoregulate quite effectively in normal to moderate conditions with appropriate clothing and rehydration but have reduced ability to adapt to temperature extremes. In a hot environment, children show less heat dissipation than adults because of a lower sweat rate and evaporative heat loss and a greater heat production per kilogram of body weight. Children also acclimate to heat more slowly than adults. In a cold environment, the high surface area-to-body mass ratio of children can accelerate heat loss, increasing their risk of hypothermia. In children, exertion-related deaths are uncommon and are generally related to congenital heart defects or acquired",

Unfortunately, efforts to identify the most effective protocol for developing flexibility have been limited in comparison to the other basic components of physical fitness. What is almost universally accepted, although not documented, is the fact that maintaining adequate levels of flexibility enhances an individual’s functional capabilities (e.g., bending and twisting) and reduces injury potential (e.g., risk of muscle strains, low back problems, and falls)—particularly for the aged. Exercises should be prescribed for every major joint (hip, back, shoulder, knee, upper trunk, and neck regions) in the body. A well-rounded program of stretching can counteract the usual decline in flexibility of the elderly and improve balance and agility. Yoga and tai chi movements may be helpful in this regard. Not surprisingly, it is critical that a sound stretching program be included as part of each exercise session for older adults (23):",

To date, however, human studies indicate that healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancy do not need to limit their exercise for fear of adverse effects (24,25). No consistent differences have been reported between exercisers and nonexercisers in terms of rate of spontaneous abortion or rupture, incidence of preterm labor, fetal distress or birth abnormalities, and ability to carry to term. Several physiologic adaptations occur with both pregnancy and exercise that appear to provide the physiologic reserve needed to accommodate the simultaneous needs of the fetus and maternal exercising muscle (25). Although some data suggest that strenuous exercise may lead to delivery of somewhat lighter birth weight babies, these deliveries are well within normal limits and are due in part to less baby fat.",

Regular exercise (at least 3 times per week) is preferable to intermittent activity.\n* Women should avoid exercise in the supine position after the first trimester. Such a position is associated with decreased cardiac output in most pregnant women. Because the remaining cardiac output will be preferentially distributed away from splanchnic beds (including the uterus) during vigorous exercise, such regimens are best avoided during pregnancy. Prolonged periods of motionless standing should also be avoided.\n* Women should be aware of the decreased oxygen available for aerobic exercise during pregnancy. They should be encouraged to modify the intensity of their exercise according to maternal symptoms. Pregnant women should stop exercising when fatigued and not exercise to exhaustion. Weight-bearing exercises may under some circumstances be continued at intensities similar to those prior to pregnancy throughout pregnancy. Non–weight-bearing exercises, such as cycling or swimming, will minimize the risk of injury and facilitate the continuation of exercise during pregnancy.\n* Morphologic changes in pregnancy should serve as a relative contraindication to types of exercise in which loss of balance could be detrimental to maternal or fetal well-being, especially in the third trimester. Further, any type of exercise involving the potential for even mild abdominal trauma should be avoided.\n* Pregnancy requires an additional 300 kcal/day to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Thus, women who exercise during pregnancy should be particularly careful to ensure an adequate diet.\n* Pregnant women who exercise in the first trimester should augment heat dissipation by ensuring adequate hydration, appropriate clothing, and optimal environmental surroundings during exercise.\n* Many of the physiologic and morphologic changes of pregnancy persist 4 to 6 weeks postpartum.

The term compliance can have subjective, even paternalistic, connotations when used to describe nonadherence to recommended medical therapeutics. As health care professionals, it is important to acknowledge that although behavior change may seem important and necessary, the process for the client or patient involves complex emotional and physical changes. For instance, a person with hypertension may not experience any negative symptoms from this condition. However, taking medications known to lessen stroke and heart attack from hypertension may result in side effects such as fatigue or constipation. “Compliance” in this situation may be problematic unless specific educational strategies are implemented. Fitness and rehabilitation professionals face the challenge of working with clients and their families, as well as the community, to develop methods of changing negative health-related behaviors. To achieve positive changes in health-related behaviors, a clear understanding of adult learning processes and the psychological influences on learning and behavior change are important. This chapter addresses the challenge of exercise compliance, concepts of adult learning, and psychological components of successful behavior change, and suggests practical strategies to improve behavioral change outcomes.",

Therefore, it may extend the day or compete with other valued interests and responsibilities of daily life. The traditional approach to the exercise compliance problem has involved attempting to persuade dropouts to become reinvolved. An alternative approach, however, involves the identification and subsequent monitoring of “dropout prone” individuals, with an aim toward preventing recidivism.  \n>  \n> Principal factors related to long-term exercise noncompliance include cigarette smoking, blue collar employment, inactive leisure time, and inactive occupation. The noncompliance rate appears to increase progressively, from 59% in the presence of smoking alone, the single most discriminating variable, to 95% with all four variables (3,4). Additional characteristics of the early exercise dropout are shown in Box 12-1, with specific reference to personal, program, and related factors. Nevertheless, psychosocial variables, including perception of the program, personal convenience factors, and family lifestyle components appear to present the major impediment to exercise compliance, accounting for almost half of all dropouts in rehabilitation programs (2,5).

Beliefs are seen as the fundamental driving force behind behavior. The perceived ability to achieve successful behavior change can be measured by assessing \"self-efficacy.\" Clients or patients who have a low \"self-efficacy\" are less likely to be successful at behavior change (18,19). As a result, these individuals are often seen as \"noncompliant.\" Assessing \"self-efficacy\" and beliefs regarding behavior change sets the stage for successful long-term change (18,19). Methods of assessing \"self-efficacy\" include having clients or patients rate their confidence that they can make a behavior change on a scale from 0 to 100%. The lower the rating, the less likely it is that an individual will be able to make and sustain long-term change. Ratings less than 70% are associated with a lower chance of successful change. With a low self-efficacy rating, education needs to be directed at discovering the beliefs and/or barriers to change. For instance, a patient may have a low rating of self-efficacy to stop smoking if the spouse or partner continues to smoke. In this case, efforts to address smoking cessation with a partner may increase confidence and chances for long-term successful change.",

The techniques presented here should be integrated into the exercise program in a way that is appropriate to the population, the setting, and the expertise of the staff. An effective program would selectively incorporate several of these techniques into a focused multifactorial program; however, it is not necessary to use all of them (12,13). The techniques are only introduced in this chapter; additional readings, relevant training, or consultation from an expert in behavior change should be used to complement this information. The *ACSM’s Resource Manual for Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription* contains several chapters that address health counseling skills (24), principles of health behavior change (15), and initiation, adoption, and maintenance strategies to promote physical activity (25,26).

Some women may be uncomfortable participating in a male-dominated physical conditioning program. Several factors may restrict physical activity with patients of increasing age: poor health, fear of injury, and inaccessibility to fitness facilities. Among obese individuals, unique barriers include previous negative experiences with exercise (feelings of inadequacy, limited physical skills) and the physiologic and psychosocial burden of their excess weight. Nevertheless, these obstacles can oftentimes be overcome with careful program design, including interventions to improve self-efficacy (37). The role of the health care provider is to facilitate the decision to participate in regular exercise and other health-related habits, to support these lifestyle changes over time, and to provide training to prevent relapse to the former undesirable behavior.",

Home-based fitness programs also can be as effective as group interventions for improving functional capacity and modifying coronary risk factors (e.g., smoking, hyperlipidemia) (41,42). Drawbacks, however, include the limited means of teaching clients (patients) necessary principles and proscriptions for exercise, the lack of opportunity to counsel and encourage lifestyle changes, and the absence of direct medical surveillance, emergency care, and peer support. Several program modifications have been used to overcome these limitations successfully, including regular telephone contact between staff and participants, mail (e.g., completion of activity logs), fax, video recording, the Internet, and transtelephonic ECG monitoring of those at increased risk of future cardiac events (40,42).",

After establishing rapport with clients and/or patients, program staff should direct those who want to quit to well-designed education, counseling, and behavioral interventions (including relapse prevention) targeted at smoking cessation. Such programs generally produce quit rates of 15 to 25% in the general population of smokers (43). Quit rates increase substantially for persons with smoking-related cardiorespiratory diseases, with up to 70% of patients quitting 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (using biochemical verification of smoking status) when provided with an intensive nurse-managed program (42). In contrast, self-quit rates have been estimated to be less than 3% in the general population of smokers (44).",

Although the causes of obesity are complex and include genetic, hormonal, and other medical conditions, most people who are excessively fat exercise too little relative to their caloric intake. According to the *Physical Activity and Health* report by the Surgeon General (48), low levels of physical activity, resulting in fewer calories used than consumed, contribute to the high prevalence of obesity in the United States. Nevertheless, inactivity is only half of the energy balance equation; total calories also count. Despite a modest decrease in the percentage of calories consumed as fat, surveys indicate that Americans are consuming more calories overall (46).",

The initial objective should be to reduce body weight by about 10% from baseline, with a goal of 1 to 2 lb per week over a 6-month treatment period (49). With success, and if warranted, further weight loss can be initiated. *A continued physical activity program appears to be the best predictor of long-term weight loss and its subsequent maintenance.* Finally, physicians should have their patients on a combined program of caloric restriction and exercise for at least 6 months before embarking on drug therapy.

Key elements of the tort system are reviewed, including the ways that written or oral contracts dictate certain provider obligations (duties) owed to a client and how standards of care, performance failures, and proximate cause contribute to or are involved in negligence and malpractice actions. Information is provided about liability and risk management issues that are important to consider with informed consent, delivery of exercise services, and the conduct and credentialing of exercise personnel. The scope of this chapter, however, permits only a cursory treatment of this subject. Interested readers who want more comprehensive information and analysis of new litigation issues involving exercise, should consult other sources (1–3).",

To appreciate the many sources of legal vulnerability, consider all the points of provider interaction with clients in the context of exercise and other services, where insult or injury may occur, and how they might be perceived by clients as attributable to some professional failure. These areas may include preactivity health screening, exercise tests, health-fitness counseling, exercise prescription, and the comprehensive delivery of physical activity programs. Such matters may also involve written operating manuals, policies, procedures, and practices within an exercise program and how these collectively dictate the standard of service (care) delivered to clients. In addition, the way that programs write and use marketing materials to portray the competence of staff and sophistication of programs may also be of significant legal importance. These include the contract and informed consent process, how consultations about clients are conducted with health care providers, and how service fulfillment is documented. Finally, the physical settings where activity programs are carried out, how equipment is used and maintained, how exercise personnel are trained and credentialed, and what steps are employed to instruct, monitor, and supervise the exercising client are all of concern. Each and every one of these dimensions of service might be a focus of legal challenge should a legal claim and suit arise from a personal injury to a client.",

Legally, to perform a specific procedure, the *client* first must give the provider an *informed* consent. The intention is to ensure that the client enters into the procedure after a full disclosure of all relevant facts, knowledge of the material risks, information about any alternative procedures that are available and might satisfy certain of the objectives, and any benefits associated with that activity for which informed consent is sought. Informed consent can be written or the law may imply it, depending on how the parties to the procedure conducted themselves. The written approach certainly is preferable to any oral or implied form, should questions later arise (see Chapter 3 for sample forms [2,4,5]). If the informed consent is written and includes the professional’s notations on important questions received (from the client) and answers given (by the professional), this may be helpful if legal questions arise later. Such notations tend to support the requirement that client comprehension was part of the process that led him/her to agree to affix their signature to the informed consent and thereby agree to the procedure.

These informed-consent cases can involve claims related to contract laws, warranties, negligence, and malpractice. Suits arising from alleged deficiencies in the informed consent process related to testing, exercise prescription, or physical activity have become more commonplace (3).

Written authorization should also be secured from clients in situations when there is an intent to use their data in reporting group statistics for program evaluation or research purposes—even when such information is presented in ways not identifiable with the client.

There are specific provisions in the Louisiana act that may affect practitioners in a variety of ways.

      "text": "Policies and procedures that are correlated to relevant national standards provide yet another important step in managing legal risks for exercise programs. Likewise, program forms and checklists created for such protocols as preactivity health/fitness screening of clients, exercise testing, exercise monitoring, and client orientation/instruction represent tangible links to national standards as a function of their design and relationship to a program’s operating manual. Finally, the thoroughness and consistency by which staff members record information on these forms and also act on such information is of critical importance to the defense of legal challenges. Consistent and accurate record keeping, done contemporaneously with delivery of service, provides powerful verification of fulfillment in accordance with the standard that a program has adopted. Of course, such recordings can be most damaging in a liability case should these provide evidence of negligence and proximate cause in connection with harm to a client. Exercise professionals should design and use recording forms and protocol checklists routinely to assure standardization in every area where injury and/or legal risks are considered significant. These might include, but are not limited to, dated checklists of equipment and supplies reviewed for exercise emergency situations, checklists for instructing new clients in exercise routines or explaining specific cautions for avoidance of injury, and inspection checklists for routine examination of equipment and facilities.",

Although some cases pertaining to equipment arise due to claims of improper design or manufacture, a good number of these also deal with improper provider assembly, maintenance or repair, or failures to properly provide instruction, warning, or supervision to clients. Many programs face such claims without adequate preparation and without having met the appropriate standard of care in reference to the equipment used in their facilities. All these potential equipment liability areas deserve close and ongoing attention so that claims and suits might be minimized.",

A prime example relates to the question of who is legally authorized and who is proscribed from providing emergency cardiac care in community or clinic settings for exercising cardiac patients. There is no doubt that the emergency response standard for this situation is clear and universal (see Appendix B and related publications [5,10]) in calling for a defibrillator, crash (“code”) cart with artificial airways, suction pump, and emergency drugs. Furthermore, the standard is clear that such settings should include an on-site provider who is able to administer advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) as delineated by the AHA (10). The provider of emergency services, however, must understand that he or she cannot assume such duties unless the physician in charge has given written standing orders to that effect and the individual has legal authority under state statutes to accept such standing orders. This almost is never the case for the nonlicensed exercise professional, with or without current successful training in an ACLS program of the AHA.",

In such situations, the nonlicensed provider runs the risk of engaging in unauthorized practices that could lead to both criminal and civil sanctions. Many states have defined the practice of medicine broadly so that nonlicensed persons engaged in exercise testing and prescription activities could, under some circumstances, fall within the limits of such statutes. Without the presence or assistance of a physician or other licensed allied health professional for certain aspects of these exercise services, claims as to the unauthorized practice of medicine could be put forth.",

Under this rule, the exercise professional’s actions would be compared to an assumed standard of care of a physician or other allied health professional acting under the same or similar circumstances.

This has prompted the ACSM and others (9,15) to clarify roles and responsibilities for these collaborative situations between physicians and nonlicensed exercise professionals. The most comprehensive effort in this area to date is reflected by the competency certifications of the ACSM (see Appendix F for knowledge, skills, and abilities that define the ACSM certification programs). The latter is complemented by the AACVPR Core Competency position statement for Cardiac Rehabilitation Specialists (15). Another development in this area occurred when the Louisiana legislature passed the previously mentioned bill to license clinical exercise physiologists, or CEPs (6). This particular act authorizes exercise professionals with specified qualifications to provide care to patients who are enrolled in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs, so long as they do so in Louisiana while under the direction, approval, and supervision of a licensed physician. This law is so new that it is not yet possible to assess its implications for differentiation of practice patterns among CEPs. However, it may well evolve into a variety of new collaborative arrangements for CEPs and physicians that were unanticipated by the practice act.",

The intent is to provide a credential that will advance patient care in an ever-broadening range of chronic diseases and conditions where emerging scientific and clinical evidence indicates that the exercise provides therapeutic effects, functional benefits, or both. The scope of clients to be served by the RCEP will be considerable and will include, but is not limited to, those with cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, immunologic, inflammatory, orthopedic, and neuromuscular diseases and conditions. The RCEP’s scope of competencies will encompass exercise evaluation, exercise prescription, exercise supervision, exercise education, and exercise outcome evaluation. The RCEP’s clients will be restricted to those who are referred by and are under the continuing care of a licensed physician. This credential is expected to increase access to quality exercise services for patients, with the added assurance that the outcomes will promote fitness development, health-related quality of life, and independent living. Of equal importance, this new ACSM credential will, by design, include certain steps that will help reshape related academic programs in higher education across the United States and facilitate career opportunities nationally for exercise clinicians. The fact that the RCEP is expected to work with patients under conditions of significant autonomy, yet do so only on the basis of physician referral, will pose some special liability concerns, as well as those concerns related to practice areas reserved by various state laws to licensed health care professionals. Therefore, RCEPs will need individualized legal counsel in their jurisdictions, special liability insurance coverage, and rigorous standards of practice so that they may appropriately manage their legal risks.",

These injuries will result in a rising number of negligence-type claims that will ultimately find resolution in court. The probabilities of such actions are low, particularly for individuals and organizations that operate programs in a manner commensurate with rigorous standards and guidelines. Awareness of the main areas of legal vulnerability and adoption of legally sensitive practices may help to reduce risks of litigation. Simultaneously, this should result in more efficacious and satisfying programs for clients. Ultimately, the most effective shield against claims of negligence may be development of professional competency by individual practitioners and a daily pattern of adhering to the most relevant and rigorous published guidelines. Professionals would be well advised to keep up to date as information on new standards and litigation in this rapidly changing field becomes available (3).",

Thus, P waves and QRS complexes in the ECG are unrelated. AV dissociation may be complete or transient or permanent. The causes of AV dissociation are \"block,\" and \"interference,\" and both may be present in the same ECG. \"Block\" is associated with a pathologic state of refractoriness, preventing the primary pacemaker's impulses from reaching the lower chamber. An example of this is sinus rhythm with complete AV block. \"Interference\" results from slowing of the primary pacemaker or acceleration of a subsidiary pacemaker. The lower chamber's impulse \"interferes\" with conduction by producing physiologic refractoriness, and AV dissociation results. An example of this is sinus rhythm with AV junctional tachycardia and no retrograde conduction into the atria. A clear distinction must be made between block and interference. This table describes the four types of AV ventricular association.*",

Although these two calculated variables are sometimes used synonymously, there is one important distinction between them. Respiratory exchange ratio is a ventilatory measurement and reflects gas exchange between the lungs and the pulmonary blood. Respiratory quotient is a measurement based solely on cellular respiration and is equivalent to RER only under steady-state conditions. RQ provides information about substrate utilization at the cellular level, equaling 1.0 for carbohydrate oxidation, 0.7 for fat oxidation, and approximately 0.8 for protein oxidation. RQ therefore always falls between 0.7 and 1.0. RER, however, exceeds 1.0 during heavy non–steady-state or maximal exercise due to hyperventilation (which increases CO₂ release by the lungs) and buffering of lactic acid in the blood (which provides a nonmetabolic source of CO₂). The energy expenditure associated with a given level of oxygen uptake varies slightly with RQ (about 4.69 kcal per L of O₂ at an RQ of 0.7, and 5.05 at an RQ of 1).

Failure to achieve a steady state results in an overestimation of $\\dot{V}O_2$.\n* Although the accuracy of these equations is unaffected by most environmental influences (heat and cold), variables that change the mechanical efficiency (e.g., gait abnormalities; wind, snow, or sand) result in a loss of accuracy.\n* Inherent assumptions for the use of the equations presuppose that ergometers are calibrated properly and used appropriately, e.g., no rail-holding during treadmill exercise.",

The oxygen demand of running is twice as great, i.e., 0.2 mL·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ (2,3). The oxygen demand of raising one’s body mass against gravity at sea level is approximately 1.8 mL per kg of body mass for each m of vertical distance (1.8 mL·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹) (4–6). The vertical distance is the product of the distance along the surface and the sine of the angle the surface makes with the horizontal. Typically, the tangent (i.e., fractional grade) is substituted for the sine, and this introduces only a small error for grades less than 20%. The oxygen cost of vertical ascent in treadmill running is half that of walking, or 0.9 mL·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ (3), and over-ground inclined running has the same oxygen cost as treadmill grade running (7). Running on a level surface is more costly than walking due to the greater vertical displacement that occurs between each step. Some of the vertical displacement of horizontal running is applied to the vertical ascent during grade running, reducing the coefficient for that factor. The resting oxygen uptake, 3.5 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹, is added to give the gross cost.",

Exercise results in the production of large amounts of body heat that must be dissipated; if not, body temperature increases, eventually reaching dangerous levels. High ambient temperature and humidity impede the body’s normal mechanisms for dissipating body heat. Unfortunately, no single standard defines safe upper limits for temperature and humidity during exercise. However, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has a position stand with recommendations concerning heat stress and distance running (1). Furthermore, guidelines promulgated to manage heat stress effects in industrial and military settings also can be applied to exercise environments (2,3). These guidelines can help to prevent excessive elevations in body temperature during physical exertion and mitigate the deleterious effects of dehydration.",

One index integrating the effects of all these factors into a single value quantifying heat stress is the wet-bulb globe temperature, or WBGT. The WBGT combines three measurements: dry-bulb air temperature (T_b); natural wet-bulb temperature (T_wb(n)) measured by placing a wetted wick over the thermometer bulb exposed to natural air movement; and globe temperature (T_g), that is, the temperature measured inside a 15-cm diameter copper globe painted flat black.

The first such use of WBGT was in the mid 1950s at military bases, where WBGT limits for physical activities during hot weather were established. Subsequently, other organizations promulgated similar WBGT guidelines for monitoring and/or quantifying heat stress and preventing heat injury during work and recreation (1–3). Use of WBGT-based guidelines has successfully reduced the incidence of heat illness during hot-weather physical activity (4). However, limitations concerning the use of WBGT should be appreciated. The WBGT was derived empirically rather than rationally from physiologic principles governing human body heat balance and thermoregulation. With high humidity, the WBGT tends to underestimate the risk of heat illness (4). Furthermore, WBGT does not account for factors such as clothing, exercise intensity, age, fitness, acclimatization, and health status, all of which influence the body’s thermal balance and modify the physiologic strain imposed by a given environmental stress.",

These actions include limiting the maximum duration of continuous exercise completed and incorporating required rest breaks before another exercise period is initiated.

With heat acclimatization, lower heart rates and body temperatures are elicited at a given exercise intensity, sweating rate increases, and the sweat becomes more dilute. Thus, heat dissipation is facilitated, and the physiologic strain of exercise in the heat is diminished. The best method of inducing heat acclimation is to exercise in the heat, progressively increasing the duration and/or intensity of exercise each day. Individuals whose exercise prescription specifies a THR should maintain the same exercise heart rate in the heat. This approach reduces the risk of heat illness while allowing acclimatization to develop. For example, in hot or humid weather, a reduced speed or resistance will achieve the THR, even though the work of the heart (myocardial oxygen uptake) remains unchanged. As acclimatization occurs, a progressively higher exercise intensity will be tolerated and required to elicit the THR. The first exercise session in the heat may last as little as 10 to 15 minutes for safety reasons, but exercise duration can be increased gradually to its usual length. Most healthy people become fully acclimatized to the heat in 10 to 14 days, although illness or alcohol consumption may slow this process.",

However, a simple suggestion is for exercise program participants to drink 2 cups of fluid 2 hours before exercise; during exercise, they should attempt to drink fluids at a rate matching sweat losses (5).

These injuries are hypothermia (subnormal body core temperature) and frostbite (freezing of body tissues, typically skin of the periphery). Cold ambient temperatures favor body heat loss, and wind can exacerbate the heat loss (4). The wind chill index (WCI), which purports to integrate the potential stress arising from both factors, has achieved popular acceptance and is widely reported (8). The WCI estimates the combined cooling effects of wind and air temperature (8) and is typically used in tables to depict temperatures of \"calm\" air having equivalent cooling rates as different combinations of air temperature and wind speed.",

Lacking any better tool, these tables still are useful guidelines concerning the conduct or cancellation of outdoor activities; however, as with the WBGT, limitations to this approach should be appreciated. The wind chill concept is sound, but the equation for calculating WCI appears flawed in its physical and physiologic rationale (9). Wind chill tables overestimate the effect of increasing wind on the risk of tissue freezing, while underestimating the effect of decreasing air temperature (9). Further, the danger zones indicated in wind chill tables estimate risk of tissue freezing only for the exposed skin of sedentary persons. Thus, persons exercising in windproof clothing are at less risk of frostbite than the wind chill tables would suggest.

During water immersion, conductive and convective heat transfer can be 70-fold greater than in air of the same temperature (4), depending on the water depth and amount of body surface immersed.

The effects of cold air breathing during exercise are usually negligible. Upper airway temperatures, which remain unchanged during exercise under temperate conditions, fall substantially when extremely cold air (< −25°F) is breathed during strenuous exercise, but temperatures of the lower respiratory tract and deep body temperatures are unaffected (10). Pulmonary function during exercise is unaffected by breathing cold air in healthy athletes (11) and nonathletes (12). In allergy-prone athletes, breathing cold air during heavy exercise may cause bronchospasm, but this bronchospasm may actually be triggered by facial cooling rather than cooling of respiratory passages (13). Chronic breathing of cold air can increase respiratory passage secretions and decrease mucociliary clearance, and any resulting airway congestion may impair pulmonary mechanics during exercise (14).",

Cold exposure, even when mild, stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which, in turn, mediates systemic responses including elevations in total peripheral resistance, arterial pressure, myocardial contractility, and cardiac work during both rest and exercise (15). This probably explains why patients with coronary artery disease exercising outdoors often experience angina pectoris and ST-segment depression at lower exercise intensities in cold rather than warm weather (15). Some evidence suggests that, compared with those of younger persons, older persons’ vasomotor adjustments in response to cold exposure may become slower and less effective in curtailing skin blood flow, but the increase in blood pressure is more pronounced in otherwise healthy persons over 50 years old (6). Particular caution should be advised for outdoor activities like chopping wood and snow shoveling (16,17), which require significant upper body use, since use of upper body muscle groups can greatly exacerbate blood pressure responses during exercise (15). Mortality due to coronary artery disease is well known to increase in winter, but to what extent this reflects the effects of cold exposure on unaccustomed physical activity remains unclear (15).",

Therefore, at sea level, compression of air by the atmosphere above causes air density and barometric pressure to be greater than at higher elevations, where there is less atmosphere above compressing the air. Even in pressurized cabins, commercial airline passengers are exposed to barometric pressure reductions equivalent to altitudes of 5000 to 8000 feet. Because the fractional concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere (F\\(_{O_2}\\)) remains constant at 0.2093, the decreasing barometric pressure with increasing altitude is also associated with a decreasing pressure of oxygen in the inspired air (P\\(_{O_2}\\)).",

As a result, VO\\(_{2max}\\) is lower at high altitude than sea level. The increased cardiovascular strain of exercise and the reduced VO\\(_{2max}\\) at high altitude compromise work capacity and endurance. These impairments usually become noticeable at about 5000 feet above sea level (even lower for some very fit athletes) and worsen with increasing elevation.

With this exponential growth, ACSM has taken steps to ensure that its competency-based certifications will continue to be regarded as the premier program in the exercise field. A periodical dealing with professional practice issues targeted to those who are certified, *ACSM Certified News*, is one example. Implementation of continuing education requirements for maintenance of certification is another. Continuing education credits can be accrued through ACSM-sponsored educational programs such as ACSM workshops (Exercise Leader®, Health/Fitness Instructor_SM_, and Exercise Specialist®), regional chapter and annual meetings, and other educational programs approved by the ACSM Professional Education Committee. These enhancements are intended to support continuing professional growth of those who have made a commitment to service in this rapidly growing health and fitness field. ACSM also acknowledges the expectation from successful candidates that the public will be informed of the high standards, values, and professionalism implicit in meeting these certification requirements. Most recently, the College has formally organized its volunteer committee structure and national office staff to give added emphasis to informing the public, professionals, and government agencies about issues of critical importance to ACSM. Informing these constituencies about the meaning and value of ACSM certification is one important priority that will be given attention in this initiative.",
